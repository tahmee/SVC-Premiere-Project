# SVC-Premiere-Project
-This project is about the global climate risk index, what countries are affected the most and how it affects their economy  
-The dataset used for this project was gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-climate-risk-index-and-related-economic-l)  
-The analysis carried out is to show if there is a positive correlation between a country's climate risk index rank and a downward trend in their economy  
-The analysis also covers checks on if there are any other variables that can be affected by a country's climate risk index and how drastic are this effects  
## Conclusion. 
From the analysis carried out, it was proven that countries with high climate change risk index suffer or are prone to negative trends in the country’s economy. However, the climate risk index does not have a direct negative effect on a country’s economy as there are many factors associated to determine this.  

These findings showed relationships between the cri score, fatalities rank, cri rank and losses usdm ppp rank. How an increase in a country’s Critical Risk Index (cri) score or rank could cause an increase in fatalities that would in turn affect a country’s PPP(Purchasing Power Parity) thereby affecting the country’s gdp.A machine learning model was developed and deployed to help predict possible gdp outcomes for countries considering their cri score, fatalities rank and usdm ppp rank.
