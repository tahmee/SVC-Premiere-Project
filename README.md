# SVC-Premiere-Project
This project is about the risks of climate change, what countries are affected the most and how it affects their economy  
The dataset used for this project was gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-climate-risk-index-and-related-economic-l)  
The analysis carried out is to show if there is a positive correlation between a country's climate risk index rank and a downward trend in their economy  
The analysis also covers checks on if there are any other variables that can be affected by a country's climate risk index and how drastic are this effects
